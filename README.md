# Django DTG (Direct-to-Garment) Store Manager

A Django/Python-based app that syncs DTG vendor APIs locally to provide tools and visibility into your products to make it easier to manage.

I created this tool to allow me to make it easier to see all of my options for designing dropship printing products through Print Aura and The Printful.


## Getting Started / Documentation
