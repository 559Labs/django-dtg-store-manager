    "note": "We'wha (1849\u20131896, various spellings) was a Zuni Native American from New Mexico. They were the most famous lhamana, a traditional Zuni gender role, now described as mixed-gender or Two-Spirit. Lhamana were male-bodied but performed primarily feminine tasks, wearing a mixture of women's and men's clothing and doing a great deal of women's work as well as serving as mediators.\r\n\r\nWe'wha is the subject of the book The Zuni Man-Woman by Will Roscoe. The anthropologist Matilda Coxe Stevenson also wrote a great deal about We'wha, and even hosted them on their visit to Washington D.C. in 1886. During that visit, We'wha met President Grover Cleveland and was generally mistaken for a cisgender woman. One of the anthropologists close to them described We'wha as \"the strongest character and the most intelligent of the Zuni tribe\" (Roscoe, 1991, p. 29). They are historically known mainly for their nonbinary gender performance. In the nineteenth century this status was called berdache, being anatomically one sex but performing tasks that were equated with the other (Roscoe, 1991, pg.29). During their lifetime, they came in contact with many white settlers, teachers, soldiers, missionaries, and anthropologists. One anthropologist they met was Matilda Coxe Stevenson, who would later become a prominent figure in We'wha's life. Stevenson wrote down her observations of We'wha, going on to state, \"She performs masculine religious and judicial functions at the same time that she performs feminine duties, tending to laundry and the garden\" (Suzanne Bost, 2003, pg.139).",

D'\u00c9on had androgynous physical characteristics and natural abilities as a mimic, good features for a spy. D'\u00c9on appeared publicly as a man and pursued masculine occupations for 49 years, although during that time d'\u00c9on successfully infiltrated the court of Empress Elizabeth of Russia by presenting as a woman. For 33 years, from 1777, d'\u00c9on dressed as a woman, identifying as female. Doctors who examined d'\u00c9on's body after death discovered \"male organs in every respect perfectly formed\", but also feminine characteristics.",

The Independent reported, however, that, as an adult, Lyman was \"known to acquaintances as a man\" and cultivated \"a male identity.\"[1] Lyman's family members, however, have contended that there's no evidence that Lyman ever received sexual reassignment surgery and that therefore he should still be considered a woman.[2] Lyman disappeared in 1987 and was declared dead in 1995.[3]",

After graduation from the University of Edinburgh Medical School, Barry served in India and Cape Town, South Africa. By the end of his career, he had risen to the rank of Inspector General in charge of military hospitals. In his travels he not only improved conditions for wounded soldiers, but also the conditions of the native inhabitants. Among his accomplishments was the first caesarean section in Africa by a British surgeon in which both the mother and child survived the operation.[1]Dr James Barry should not be confused with Dr James Barry, lawyer.[2]\r\n\r\nAlthough Barry lived his adult life as a man, he was assigned female at birth, named Margaret Ann Bulkley.[3] He chose to live as a man so that he might be accepted as a university student and able to pursue a career as a surgeon,[1] with his sex only being discovered by the public and his colleagues after his death. Barry was the first qualified female British doctor or surgeon known, anticipating Elizabeth Garrett Anderson by over 50 years.",

    "note": "Willmer M. \"Little Ax\" Broadnax (December 28, 1916[1] \u2013 June 1, 1992),[2] also known as \"Little Axe\", \"Wilbur\", \"Willie\", and \"Wilmer\", was an African-American hard gospel quartet singer. A tiny man with glasses and a high, powerful tenor voice, he worked and recorded with many of the most famous and influential groups of his day.\r\n\r\nBroadnax was born in Houston, Texas in 1916. After moving to Southern California in the mid-1940s, he and his brother, William, joined the Southern Gospel Singers, a group which performed primarily on weekends. The Broadnax brothers soon formed their own quartet, the Golden Echoes. William eventually left for Atlanta, where he joined the Five Trumpets, but Willmer stayed on as lead singer. In 1949 the group, augmented by future Soul Stirrer Paul Foster, recorded a single of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" for Specialty Records. Label chief Art Rupe decided to drop them before they could record a follow-up, and shortly thereafter the Golden Echoes disbanded.[1]\r\n\r\nIn 1950, Broadnax joined the Spirit of Memphis Quartet. Along with Broadnax, the group featured two other leads -- Jethro \"Jet\" Bledsoe, a bluesy crooner, and Silas Steele, an overpowering baritone. This was one of the most impressive line-ups in quartet history. The Spirit of Memphis Quartet recorded for King Records, and Broadnax appeared on their releases at least until 1952. Shortly after that, however, he moved on, working with the Fairfield Four, and, in the beginning of the 60s, as one of the replacements for Archie Brownlee in the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi. Until 1965 he headed a quartet called \"Little Axe and the Golden Echoes,\" which released some singles on Peacock Records. By then, quartet singing was fading as a commercial phenomenon, and Broadnax retired from touring, though he did continue to record occasionally with the Blind Boys into the 70s and 80s.\r\n\r\nUpon his death in 1992, it was discovered that Broadnax was female assigned at birth.",

Jorgensen grew up in the Bronx, New York City. Shortly after graduating from high school in 1945, she was drafted into the U.S. Army for World War II. After her service she attended several schools, worked, and around this time heard about sex reassignment surgery. She traveled to Europe and in Copenhagen, Denmark, obtained special permission to undergo a series of operations starting in 1951.",
